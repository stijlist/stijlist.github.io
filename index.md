# Bert Muthalaly

I'm a programmer and student of economics based in Austin, TX. 
I'm interested in the intersection of engineering, business, and the
improvement of human welfare.

My projects are on [GitHub][1], and I write over at
[somethingdoneright.net][2].

I try to focus on the fact that technology is a tool, and it's more important 
to focus on the effects our technology has on us is than how it's implemented, 
all else equal.

On the flip side, the way you build your software can drastically change the
[nature of the process][3], so it's foolish not to study 
interesting methods of writing software.

In my projects, I strive to:

- minimize complexity
- avoid writing programs when reusing an already-written program will be
  effective
- avoid complex configuration of the software I'm using when possible
- take advantage of type information (especially static typing, where possible)
- write comprehensive tests
- cleanly separate different concerns into different objects, modules, or programs
- be aware of the trade-offs each design decision entails
- iterate quickly
- and try and fail fast if a project is going to fail.

To design and implement software, I've used a variety of programming 
languages:

- Ruby 
- Javascript
- Java
- Objective-C

frameworks:

- Rails
- Cocoa Touch
- Spring

and computer systems:

- Linux (Arch, Ubuntu)
- OS X
