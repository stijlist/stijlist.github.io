One of the annoying things about the Walter Isaacson biography of Steve Jobs is
that he seems to have no idea why Jobs had an outsized effect on the world.
It's possible that Jobs' notoriety is due to happenstance, but it's frustrating
that businesspeople read the Isaacson biography looking for things to emulate
and take away "To get unusual positive outcomes, I should be more demanding".

I think there's a better takeaway from Jobs' history as a manager - to
understand it, the books worth reading are 'Becoming Steve Jobs' and
'Creativity, Inc'.

For the first part of his career, it's reasonable to describe Jobs as a
troubled (insecure), smart (curious), instinctive person¹ in the right place at the right time.

After he's fired from Apple, he's understandably bitter.

Due to his influence and tastes he's introduced to Ed Catmull and the Pixar folks and bankrolls them.

When it comes to managing technical and creative people on the bleeding edge of technology, Ed Catmull is the real deal - at this point in history he's been running the NYIT graphics lab that turns into Pixar for more than a decade.

From Catmull and the rest of the team, Jobs learns how to better run the technical teams at NEXT and at Apple when he returns.

The argument to make to people who read the Isaacson biography is that they
should instead be reading Ed Catmull's thoughts on running creative teams.

¹ He understands "cool" and pattern matches really well on smart people. Getting to know Woz really well early on probably built his intuition. The way he recruits Bill Atkinson once he understands that Jef Raskin thinks the world of him is representative of this.
