# Intermediate goals and minimizing wasted energy

Sometimes I notice I'm delaying accomplishing my goals by picking intermediate milestones that are mostly orthogonal to the end goal. Example goal: learning how circuits work. Example milestone: learning calculus.

This is especially wasteful when the component of the intermediate goal that contributes to the terminal goal could be learned just in time. In software, this manifests as "yak-shaving" - in life, it's more insidious, because no one holds you accountable for doing what you *really* want to do - often, I take my friends' stated intentions at face value.

Recent examples from my life:

- Take better photographs -> buy a nicer camera (instead of "take a photography course")
- Have a spacious room -> build a Murphy bed (instead of "move")
- Understand the software I use day to day -> install OpenBSD (actually a short-term setback!)
- Make a humane living -> become a better software engineer (almost orthogonal!)
- Use my time in a way that's satisfying to me -> get credentialed by a prestigious organization (almost no connection between these goals!)

When I'm setting up intermediate and terminal goals in the future, I'll aim to minimize the orthogonal components of those intermediate goals.
