<h1 id="bert-muthalaly">Bert Muthalaly</h1>
<p>I'm a programmer and student of economics based in Austin, TX. I'm interested in the intersection of engineering, business, and the improvement of human welfare.</p>
<p>In my projects, I aspire to minimize complexity, avoid writing programs when reusing an already-written program will suffice, avoid complex configuration of the software I'm using when possible, write comprehensive tests, take advantage of type information (especially static typing, where possible), and try and fail fast if a project is going to fail.</p>
<p>I try and focus on the fact that technology is a tool, and it's more important to focus on the effects our technology has on us is than how it's implemented, all else equal.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the way you build your software can drastically change the <a href="beating%20the%20averages">nature of the process</a>.</p>
<p>To design and implement software, I've used a variety of programming languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
</ul>
