<h1 id="bert-muthalaly">Bert Muthalaly</h1>
<p>I'm a programmer and student of economics based in Austin, TX. I'm interested in the intersection of engineering, business, and the improvement of human welfare.</p>
<p>My projects are on <a href="http://github.com/stijlist">GitHub</a>, and I write over at <a href="http://somethingdoneright.net">somethingdoneright.net</a>.</p>
<p>I try to focus on the fact that technology is a tool, and it's more important to focus on the effects our technology has on us is than how it's implemented, all else equal.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the way you build your software can drastically change the <a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">nature of the process</a>, so it's foolish not to study interesting methods of writing software.</p>
<p>In my projects, I strive to:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimize complexity</li>
<li>be aware of prior work in my problem domain</li>
<li>avoid writing programs when reusing an already-written program will be effective</li>
<li>avoid complex configuration of the software I'm using when possible</li>
<li>take advantage of type information (especially static typing, where possible)</li>
<li>write comprehensive tests</li>
<li>cleanly separate different concerns into different objects, modules, or programs</li>
<li>be aware of the trade-offs each design decision entails</li>
<li>iterate quickly</li>
<li>and try and fail fast if a project is going to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>To design and implement software, I've used a variety of programming languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
</ul>
<p>frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rails</li>
<li>Cocoa Touch</li>
<li>Spring</li>
</ul>
<p>and computer systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux (Arch, Ubuntu)</li>
<li>OS X</li>
</ul>
