Summer courses ended today. 
I'm free for the rest of the summer. 
The blank slate is invigorating.

I'd expressed my intention to focus on iOS development in earnest the second half of the summer, and my parents surprised me today with a Macbook. They seem to believe in me. I'm not surprised, but I am grateful.

Today:

- set up the Mac
- finished the first two lectures of Stanford CS193p
