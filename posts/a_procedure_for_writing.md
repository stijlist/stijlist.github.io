1. take notes. notes are facts, quotes, or ideas, often compiled into simple bulleted lists. having references to the source material is invaluable. [markdown](http://www.daringfireball.net/markdown) is great for this.
2. comment on the notes and re-sequence them and the associated comments into a sensible progression of ideas.
3. take the expanded notes and comments and weave them into a cohesive narrative.
4. edit. have a friend read it and give you honest feedback. re-edit. you've written a lot, and you can afford to be ruthless when you're cutting the essay back down.
5. publish. your essay is a gem, don't be bashful!
