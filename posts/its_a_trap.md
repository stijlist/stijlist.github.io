I can't shake the idea of building an OS; incorporating some of the good ideas of Plan 9, OS X, and Minix. My curiosity and naivet√© are both getting the better of me here. I really want to experiment with writing a Minix3-like self-healing kernel in Rust, and play with assembly language on an ARM chip. Other ridiculous non-goals: use Haskell for userland programs, write an OS X-like graphics & UI library (retained-mode graphics, hardware acceleration), implement a graphics card on a FPGA, run a browser on top.
