grieving is so strange. There's so many people who want to chime in and it's so impossible to know who understands where you're coming from and who doesn't. and there's always someone who has the right to take it harder than you, so it feels stupid and insignificant to spout off about it in public but inadequate to keep it to yourself and private. maybe this is one of those things that you only understand how to process with experience, and maybe it's one of those things that you will just never process properly, and that's just how life is. either way, rest in peace, Mr. Guthrie.
