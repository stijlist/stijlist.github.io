I've got a sketch of an idea for running an open-source project on Apple's App Store. Effectively, the app would be donation ware (or nagware, a la [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)), and every pull request would be voted on by the community. The community, after a pull request had been merged, would get to consistently vote on the percentage of future donations the submitters of that pull request would receive. That percentage would be sent to the submitter via whatever method is most viable. I'll intentionally defer the definition of 'most viable method' and the voting scheme to a later date (cryptocurrency?). I could probably start the project by unilaterally making decisions on which pull requests to merge and how much to pay the committing developers in royalties, and migrate slowly to a more well-defined system once the project has some traction.
