My name is Bert Muthalaly, and I'm a programmer, student of economics, and [Recurse Center][recurse center] alum based in New York City, currently taking a sabbatical.
I spent the last several years working on [Fuchsia][fuchsia] at [Google][google].
Before that, I worked at [Sefaira][sefaira].

I'm interested in the intersection of engineering, business, and the
improvement of human welfare.

My projects are on [GitHub][1], and I write here at
[somethingdoneright.net][2].

I aim to focus on the fact that technology is a tool, and it's more important 
to focus on the effects our technology has on us is than how it's implemented, 
all else equal.

On the flip side, the way you build your software can drastically change the
[nature of the process][3], so it's foolish not to study 
[interesting][vpri] [methods][forth] of [writing][bloom] [software][eve].

In my projects, I strive to:

- minimize complexity
- be aware of prior work in my problem domain
- avoid writing programs when reusing an already-written program will be
  effective
- avoid complex configuration of the software I'm using when possible
- write comprehensive tests
- cleanly separate different concerns into different objects, modules, or programs
- be aware of the trade-offs each design decision entails
- iterate quickly
- and try and fail fast if a project is going to fail.
